## Rate limits

To prevent the faucet account from draining the available funds, the Haqq TestEdge faucet imposes a maximum number of requests for a period of time. By default, the faucet service accepts 1 request per day per address. You can request ISLM from the faucet for each address only once every 24h. If you try to request multiple times within the 24h cooldown phase, no transaction will be initiated. Please try again in 24 hours.

## Amount

For each request, the faucet transfers some ISLM to the given address.
